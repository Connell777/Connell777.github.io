title: Part 1 Win The Morning

---


**Win The Morning**

I am a very firm believer in winning the morning. That doesn’t mean that I always win the morning. There has been a span of weeks where I have lost the morning and my day turned out subpar. Working from home has its perks, however since you don’t need to get out of bed and commute it can be difficult to win your morning.


**Win**

If you force yourself to get up within 30 mins of waking up, get dressed, make your bed and make breakfast you have essentially won your morning. From doing these four simple tasks i found that my day begins to snowball into productivity.


**Lose**

I have often lay in bed for two hours with my laptop open replying to emails until my first meeting of the day. These days have always lost. I don’t get dressed until 10:30 or 11, rarely make my bread and don’t eat breakfast until lunch time.
